# usmap 0.5.0.9999
* New website for the package: https://usmap.dev
  * Lightweight landing page containing useful information, links, and examples of usmap usage.
* `state` can now be omitted when using `fips()`. In this case, all available FIPS codes are returned, sorted by state abbreviation, see [Issue #28](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/28).
* `fips` can now be omitted when using `fips_info()`. In this case, all available states are returned, sorted by state abbreviation, see [Issue #28](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/28).
* Fix duplicate coordinates from being removed during `usmap_transform` (if value columns differ), see [Issue #32](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/32).
* Prevent [warnings introduced by `ggplot2` v3.3.0](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/pull/3346), see [Issue #35](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/35).
* Set minimum R version to 3.5.0. Versions lower than this do not support the latest version of the `rgdal` package.

# usmap 0.5.0
Released Friday, September 13, 2019.

### New Features
* Ability to include county name labels on county maps, see [Issue #14](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/14).
  * They currently work the same as state labels except they include the full county name (excluding the word "County").
* Ability to pass `ggplot2::geom_polygon()` parameters to `plot_usmap()`, see [Issue #15](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/15).
  * This is a breaking change and removes the `lines` parameter. The previous defaults of `color="black"`, `fill="white"`, and `size=0.4` are maintained and will be used for any of those parameters that are omitted.
  * Refer to the `ggplot2::geom_polygon()` documentation for more information.
  * The following aesthetics are supported: `alpha`, `colour`/`color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `size`
  * This feature provides more direct control over the appearance of plots.
* Ability to exclude counties and states with new `exclude` parameter in `us_map`, `map_with_data`, and `plot_usmap`, see [Issue #19](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/19).
* New function (`usmap_transform`) to transform longitude/latitude point data frames into coordinate reference system that matches the plotted map, see [Issue #21](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/21).
  * Also includes `usmap_crs()` to easily access the coordinate reference system used by the package.
  
### Improvements
* In the data frames provided by `us_map()`, `long` and `lat` have been renamed to `x` and `y`, respectively, see [Issue #16](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/16).
  * This should not affect the behavior of `plot_usmap()` but will be a breaking change for any code that relies on `us_map()`.
* Added contributing guidelines and templates, see [Issue #24](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/24).
  * These can be see in the [.github folder](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/tree/master/.github).

# usmap 0.4.0
Released Sunday, September 16, 2018.

### New Features
* Ability to include state abbreviation labels in state maps, see [Issue #9](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/9).
  * e.g. `plot_usmap(labels = TRUE)`
* Add US Census Bureau regional divisions as constants for quick plotting of certain regions.
  * e.g. `plot_usmap(include = .northeast_region)`
  * The provided regions and divisions can be seen [on this map by the US Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).
* Allow ability to include only certain states while viewing county map, see [Issue #11](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/11).
  * e.g. `us_map("counties", include = "TX")` or `plot_usmap("counties", include = c("AZ", "NM"))`

### Improvements
* Vectorize counties in `fips`, see [Issue #10](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/10).
  * e.g. `fips("NJ", c("Bergen", "Hudson"))`
* Allow all columns in the data frame that's passed to `map_with_data()` or `plot_usmap()` to be preserved.

### Bug Fixes
* Add Kusilvak Census Area (FIPS code 02158), replaces Wade Hampton Census Area (FIPS code 02270).

# usmap 0.3.0
Released Sunday, June 3, 2018.

### Improvements
* Update shape files to [2017 versions](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html).
* Improvements to `fips` and `fips_info`:
  * Vectorization support (e.g. enter multiple states in `fips` to receive a vector of corresponding FIPS codes)
  * e.g. `fips(c("AK", "AL"))` or `fips(c("Alaska", "Alabama"))`
  * Mixed abbreviations and full names are also supported: `fips(c("AK", "Alabama"))`
  * Improved warning and error messages.
* Allow data to be specified by state abbreviation or full name in `plot_usmap` and `map_with_data` (instead of just by FIPS code).
  * The data frame passed to `plot_usmap` or `map_with_data` (via the `data =` parameter), can now be a two column data frame with columns "fips" and "values" or "state" and "values".

# usmap 0.2.1
Released Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

### Improvements
* Standardize documentation language.
* Improve descriptiveness of error messages and warnings.
### Bug Fixes
* Allow data passed to `map_with_data` and `plot_usmap` to contain FIPS codes with missing leading zeros.
  * This usually occurs when the codes are read as `numeric` from a `.csv` file.

# usmap 0.2.0
Released Saturday, April 29, 2017.

* Add `map_with_data` function for adding user-defined data to map data.
* Add ability to plot map with data automatically (utilizes new `map_with_data` function).

# usmap 0.1.0
Released Sunday, January 29, 2017.

* First release

### Main features

* Retrieve US map data frame for merging with data and plotting
* Lookup FIPS codes for states and counties (reverse-lookup as well)
* Map plotting convenience method (uses `ggplot2`)
